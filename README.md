## UK Governaments Road Accidents Data for preventative measures that could be implemented to prevent more deaths on UK roads.

# Predicting-RTC-Severity-using-Machine-Learning
By harnessing the power of Machine Learning we intend to predict the severity of RTCs and RTC hotspots which would allow the local authority to implement further traffic safety measures.

### PROJECT GOALS 
1. Classifying RTC severity. 2. Identifying areas with the highest number of RTCs. 3. Identifying what type of vehicles are involved in most RTCs. 4. Monitoring the rate of RTCs over time.

For Time Series Analysis (ARIMA MODEL use TPU [googlecolab] )

We have dataset of Accident and Vehicle. We divided the dataset into four pipelines (1)RTC Severity  (2) Vehicle  (3) Time Series Analysis (4) Geospacial Analysis
We analysed the data for these pipelines separately and then for modelling final solution combined Vehicle data on Accident index and formed model in above  final file "Amended_Smote_Modelling.ipynb" . 


Predicting-RTC-Severity (Analysis) was performed on labelled and unlabelled data in above 3 jupytar  files

("Predicting-RTC-Severity_Unlabelled_Data.ipynb" , "Predicting_RTC_Severity_Labelled_Data.ipynb" , "Predicting_RTC_Severity_ist(1).ipynb" ) 
for understanding the features in depth and extracing meaningful insights.
